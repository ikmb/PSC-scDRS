Mainly Python and a bit of Bash are used as coding languages in this repository. :)

You may need to install the necessary functions before running the code from the following locations:
* scDRS: https://martinjzhang.github.io/scDRS/,
* BCFtools: https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/howtos/index.html,
* MAGMA: https://cncr.nl/research/magma/

* This project involves several steps, some of which are coded in Python and others are executed using bash command lines and must be done in a specific order.  In this regard, numbers are a guide for you.

* Flowcharts explain the steps of the method.
